=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::TemplateFiles - use files as templates to build a distribution

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In your F<dist.ini>:

  [TemplateFiles]
      filename = README
      filename = path/to/other/file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Utilize L<Text::Template> to turn certain files into templates.  Each
template has available to it the C<$dist> variable that is the instance
of L<Dist::Zilla> currently running.  Only those files listed in
C<dist.ini> as C<filename = blah> will be considered templates.
Filenames are given relative to the root of the build.
